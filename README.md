# Funded

**Funded is the result of two months of User Research and problem discovery conducted on curators and gallerists**.

The scope of this project was to focus on User Research to learn about a specific kind of user persona's life, habits, problems, and issues. We conducted interviews and surveys with our users, extrapolated our findings, and come up with possible solutions to the issues we discovered.

Funded is a concept for an app that could solve one of the most daunting issues for our users: having access to funding and grants for their activities.

Finding art grants and other funding opportunities online is a hard, long, and fatiguing process that takes most of the user's time solely because they have to navigate many different websites with dubious interfaces while looking for hard-to-find information. Funded wants to do this work for the user and show all available grants in a nice to use interface.

The original prototype was made in **Figma** and this repo is for the **SwiftUI** interface I recreated as an exercise.

The UI design is by [Maddalena Zampitelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maddalenazampitelli/).

The team that participated in the project was composed by me, Maddalena Zampitelli, Maria Smirnova and Raffaele Colantonio.
